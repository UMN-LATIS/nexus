<h3>Synopsys</h3>
<pre>
nxsbuilder [OPTIONS] [PLY FILES...]
</pre>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Nxsbuilder generates a .nxs multiresolution mesh format given one or more .ply file</p>
<p>The process involves generating a sequence of increasingly coarse partitions of the mesh, 
interleaved with simplifications steps.</p>
<p>Current implementation is based on kd-trees with differently aligned axis, other
partitioning strategy might be added in future.</p>
<p>If you need compression or streaming capabilities a pass through nxsedit is needed.</p>


<h3>Options</h3>
 <dl>
  <dt>-e FILE --nexus_file FILE</dt>
  <dd>filename of the nexus output file, .nxs is added automatically.
    If not specified the name of the first .ply is used.</dd>

  <dt>-f VALUE --faces_patch VALUE</dt> 
  <dd>average faces per patch, default value is 8000, must be less than 16000.
      Decreasing this value allow for better resolution control but reduces rendering
      performance and will increase size of the dataset.</dd>

  <dt>-N --no_normals</dt> 
  <dd>Do not compute and store per vertex normals. Normal are usually computed from the geometry,
      not read even when present in the ply.
  </dd>

  <dt>-c --colors</dt> 
  <dd>Read and preserve color per vertex information. If not present in the ply colors will 
     be present in the .nxs (albeit their value unspecified). Might be useful to add color per vertex
     in a later stage.</dd>

  <dt>-d METHOD --decimation METHOD</dt>
  <dd>Available decimation methods are: quadric (default) and edgelen. The latter method is much faster but will
    produce worse quality model (more triangles to obtain the same approximation.
    If using colors per vertex, use the edgelen method: it is important to have
    uniform edge length.</dd>

  <dt>-v --verbose</dt> 
  <dd>Verbose output.</dd>

  <dt>-p --pedantic</dt> 
  <dd>Make lots of controls and report (possible) problems.</dd>

  <dt>-A VALUE --adaptive VALUE</dt> 
  <dd>If VALUE = 0 the nodes of the kd-tree will be always splitted in half (thus
      creating an octree. When the VALUE is 1 the nodes will be split such that
      that half the triangles will fall on each half, regardless of the aspect-ratio.
      Values in the middle will balance between these extreme. Default value is 0.33.</dd>

  <dt>-r <val> --ram <val></dt> 
  <dd>max ram used (in Megabytes) [not implemented for now]</dd>

  <dt>-s VALUE --scaling VALUE</dt> 
  <dd>reduction factor [not implemented]</dd>

  <dt>-Q --cube box</dt> 
  <dd>start with a cube box, instead of the bounding box (in combination
     with -A 0 turns the partition into an octree.</dd>
